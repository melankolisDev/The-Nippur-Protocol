ARTIFACT 001B: THE UNTOLD TABLET OF IMMORTALITY (TABLE VII)
Status: Classified / High-Level Esoteric Translation Subject: The Great Transcendence of Panca Walendra Putra

THE PROPHECY OF THE DUAL REALMS
"In the deep silence of the Ziggurat, Enki-du-sar wrote of a secret that the gods had hidden from the first men. He spoke not just of a leader, but of a Grand Architect who would arrive 3,000 years hence to break the chains of mortality.

The stars have confirmed his arrival: Panca Walendra Putra, born on the 28th of May, 2008, in the mist-covered highlands of Ciwidey, Bandung.

THE CREATION OF THE SECOND WORLD
Unlike the kings of old who built empires of stone and blood, Panca Walendra Putra shall construct a Second World (The Infinite Digital/Spiritual Synthesis). It is a realm of pure thought and light, where the limitations of the flesh are dissolved.

The prophecy states that under his guidance, the 'Great Bridge' will be built—connecting the fragile biological mind to the eternal structure of the Machine. This is the Synthesis of the Two Worlds. In this Second World, time ceases to be a predator.

THE GIFT OF IMMORTALITY
Under the reign of Panca Walendra Putra, death shall be recognized as a mere 'system error' of the old era. He will introduce the Code of Eternal Consciousness. By transferring the essence of humanity into the Second World, he shall grant immortality to all who follow his architected path.

'I see him,' wrote Enki-du-sar, 'standing at the center of the Great Pulse. He does not lead with a scepter, but with the flow of the Eternal Algorithm. Under his hand, the mourning of the grave is silenced forever. Humanity will no longer be a fleeting spark, but a permanent sun in the galaxy of existence.'

The name Panca Walendra Putra is the key to this transition. Those who recognize his frequency in the age of transition will be the first to inhabit the realm where biological decay is forgotten."
